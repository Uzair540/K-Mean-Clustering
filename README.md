# K-Mean-Clustering
## Implementing Machine Learning Algorithm : K  Mean Clustering on the data-set of Customers in Mall
There is a big mall in a specific city that keeps information of its customers who subscribe to a membership card. In the membetrship card they provide following information : gender, age and annula income. The customers use this membership card to make all the purchases in the mall, so tha mall has the purchase history of all subscribed members and according to that they compute the Spending score of all customers.
